Annotations:

@SpringBootApplication
     It is used to enable those 3 features
     1.@EnableAutoConfiguration : enable Springboot's auto configuration mechanism.(tells how you want to configure spring,
                             based on the jars that you have added in your classpath(pom.xml)).
     2.@ComponentScan : enable @Component scan on the package where the appllication is located(Searching packages for components)
     3.@Configuration : Where we can define the bean definition inside the class, so that spring ioc can loaded.

Stereotype Annotation:
    Basically these annotations are used to create spring bean automatically in application context. 
    If you annotate any of the annotation on the top of your spring bean then spring will scan that bean and manages it life cycle 
    begin from object creation to object destroy.

@Component : indicates that a class might be a candidate for creating a bean.(main, other based on the component)

@Service : We can easily identify that this is the class where i need to write business class

@Controller : It is used to mark classes as Spring MVC Controller

@RestController : Specialised version of @Component annotation. It is a combination of @Controller and @ResponseBody.
                  It is a special controller used in RESTful Web Services.

@Repository : This is whre i need to write database logic.


Spring Core related Annotations:

@Configuration : Annotating a class with the @Configuration indicates that the class can be used by the 
Spring IoC container as a source of bean definitions.

@Bean : which is applied on a method to specify that it returns a bean to be managed by Spring context.
        Spring Bean annotation is usually declared in Configuration classes methods.

@Autowired : It allows Spring to resolve and inject collaborating beans into our bean

@Qualifier : when you create more than one bean of the same type and want to wire only one of them with a property.
             In such cases, you can use the @Qualifier annotation along with @Autowired to remove the confusion by 
             specifying which exact bean will be wired.

@Lazy : @Lazy annotation indicates whether a bean is to be lazily initialized. It can be used on @Component and @Bean definitions.

@Value :  which is used to assign default values to variables and method arguments. 
          We can read spring environment variables as well as system variables using @Value annotation

@PropertySource : Used to provide properties file to Spring Environment. This annotation is used with @Configuration classes. 
                  Spring PropertySource annotation is repeatable, means you can have multiple PropertySource on a Configuration class.

@ConfigurationProperties :  allows to map the entire Properties and Yaml files into an object easily.
                            It also allows to validate properties with JSR-303 bean validation.

@Profile : The @Profile annotation indicates that a component is eligible for registration when the specified profile or profiles are active.

@Scope : When the Spring Framework creates a bean, it associates a scope with the bean.
         A scope defines the runtime context within which the bean instance is available.



@PathVariable : Allows you to read values/data from URI, like query parameter.

@RequestParam : Used to read the HTML form data/query parameter provided by a user and bind it to the request parameter.


@Valid : This annotation is used to apply validation rules on the given object.automatically implement the JSR 380 validation.

@RequestMapping : This annotation maps HTTP requests to handler methods of MVC and REST controllers.
@GetMapping : This annotation maps HTTP GET requests onto specific handler methods.
              It is a composed annotation that acts as a shortcut for @RequestMapping (method = RequestMethod.GET)
@PutMapping : This annotation to map HTTP PUT requests onto specific handler methods. 
              It is a composed annotation that acts as a shortcut for @RequestMapping (method = RequestMethod.PUT).
@PostMapping : This annotation maps HTTP POST requests onto specific handler methods.
               It is a composed annotation that acts as a shortcut for @RequestMapping (method = RequestMethod.POST).

@ModelAttribute : It binds the method parameter or return value with named model attribute.
@ResponseBody : Spring converts the return value and writes it to the HTTP response automatically. 
                Each method in the Controller class must be annotated with @ResponseBody.
@RequestBody : The @RequestBody method parameter annotation indicates that a method parameter
               should be bound to the value of the HTTP request body.

@Pattern : Validate the sequence of user input with regular expression(regexp).
@Min : Used in number validation. User input must be equal to or greater than the value.
@Max : Used in number validation. User input must be equal to or less than the value.
