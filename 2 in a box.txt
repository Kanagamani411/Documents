“Two-in-a-Box” is a style of management in which two individuals are jointly responsible to manage an organization.
 On the organization chart two names are listed in “one box”. It has also been called, “Management Pairing,”
 or sometimes affectionately known as “Two-Headed” Managers.

It can be used when assigning consultants to client teams.
 The client benefits from the additional skills and perspective of the consultant.
 And the consultant works within the operational context that the client lives within — knowing when to challenge.
 Both are accountable together for the delivery results of the operational /project team.

Two-in-a-box: The basic premise of Two in a Box is that a division or group or department or even
 a project is coordinated equally by two managers.
 Two heads that can think more clearly, come up with better ideas,
 and reach out more thoroughly to outside clients and internal customers.
