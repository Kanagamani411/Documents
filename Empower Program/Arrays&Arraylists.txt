Arrays&Arraylists:

Array:
 Array is used to store collections of data  elements.
 we can store only homogenius data types.

Syntax:
 datatype[] arrayname = new datatype[];
 int[] rollno = new int[5];
 int[] rollno2 = {1,2,3,4,5};

//we cannot do like rollno = {1,2,3,4,5} we can do it in initializr itself.

 rollno1[0] = 1;
 rollno1[1] = 2;
 rollno1[2] = 3;
 rollno1[3] = 4;
 rollno1[4] = 5;
 
int[] rollno;        //declaring array rollno referance variable is defined in stack memory.
                       this thing happen compile time. static memory allocation.
rollno = new int[5]; //initialization  object is being created in heap memory. runtime.dynamic memory allocation.

new -> new is a keyword and it is used to create an object.

stack memory
   used to store reference variable,functions
   it is linear data structure so it it is continuous.
heap memory
   used to store java objects
   not continuous but hierarcical.

null:
  null is a special literal
  we can assign null value for non primitives
ex:
  String str = null;
  
  it doesnt occupy space in memory.
