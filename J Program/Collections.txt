What is collection?
   Collection is a java framework. THat stores group of objects in single unit. Collections have readymade architecture.
   We can do data manipuation like add delete search sort update etc....
   It has Classes and Interfaces

Need of Collection Framework:
   Instead of creating multiple variables we can create single variable to store multiple objects.

Classes
Al,Ll,S,V
PQ,ADeq
HS,LHS,TS
HT,LHM,HM,TM

Interface

List ->ArrayList ->LinkedList -> Stack ->Vector

Queue ->PriorityQueue
     1->Deque(I)->ArrayDeque

Set  -> HashSet-> LinkedHashSet
    l->SortedSet(I)-> TreeSet

Map Hierarchy:

Map-> HashTable,LinkedHashMap
  1->SortedMap(I)->TreeMap

Iterator

Array:
   Array is fixed in size 
   It stores homogeneous data elements
   Array is index based.
   //limitation: Readymade APIs support is not available so collection needed.
   syntex:
      int[] arr = new int[50];
