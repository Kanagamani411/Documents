What is Java:
   Java is programming language which support Object Oriented Programming.
   
What is oops:
   Object oriented programming system is a programming paradigm which has main methods of class,object,inheritance,polimorphism,abstraction,encapsulation.

Why Java?
   Top most programming language
   used to develop web application, antroid application, game development....
   platform indepenndent(a java program created in one software can run on diferent platform).
   

JDK -> Java Devlopment Kit.
       it is a development tool.used to create java application.
       along with JRE, JDK has javaDebugger,compiler.javadoc...
       it execute the java code.

    |_>JRE  -> Java Runtime Environment.
               it has java libraries along with JVM.
               It create the environment for execute java code
               it is an implementation of JVM.
               
 
           |_>JVM  -> Java virtual machine.
               it convert java byte code into machine code.
               platform independent.
               it gives implementation to jre.

 How java code run?
     first java compiler converts java source code(java.file) into byte code(class.file) and then Jvm convert the byte code into machine code(011000)
     then it display the result.


IDE -> Integrated development environment.
    A software that help us to write software.
    we have 1 software where we can type compile run in same software that is ide.
    ex: IntelliJ IDEA, Spring tool suite, Eclipse....
