Notes:
under static and main method:
//we can overload static methods.
// We cannot create more than one public class in Class
//if we need more than 1 class then we need to create seperate classes in a same package
//we canot code in java without creatinng a class
//but we can code withot creating an object
//if a method or variable need to call without object initialization then it must be "static"
//we can have same method name in 2 different classes in a same package
//we cannot call a method in class from main method of same class when the method is nonStatic
//if the method is static then we can call it directly.
//Java does not support “directly” nested methods so we cannot write method directly inside main method but we can call methods inside main method.
//we can call normal method from another class in our main method by creating object for the class 
//if its static method then we directly call by classname.methodname.
//but we cannot call normal method in main method of same class because main method is static.
//if we want to call it we need to mention it static and we dont need to create object of calling it beacause it is static. 
//if we want the method as nonstatic then we need to create obj in main method and then call it obj.methodname.


What is Variable?
    variable is used to store the data.
    int age = 23

    _ and $ are allowed as variable name.

    A variable is a container which holds the value while the Java program is executed.
    A variable is assigned with a data type. Variable is a name of memory location. 
    There are three types of variables in java: local, instance and static.

Types of Variables?

reference:
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/variables-in-java/

Local Variable:
      A variable should be declared inside a method/function/constructor.
      initialization is mandatory.
Instance Variable:
      A variable should be declared inside a class and outside a method/function/contructor.
      initialization is not mandatory.
      variable created when object initialization and destroyed when object destruction.
Static Variable:
      A variable should be declared as static keyword present inside a class and outside a method/function/constructor.
      initialization is not mandatory.
      no need to create object we can call variable using class name.

Objact caling?

Method calling?

//break is only used in loops and switch in java.
     if(true)
        break;
     will give error.
// 'j' + 'a' + 'v' + 'a'  -> will give addition of ascii value.
// "j" + 'a' + 'v' + 'a' -> will give java
