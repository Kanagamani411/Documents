static is a keyword which is used in java with member variable and member function
we can call those member without using object.dont need to intantiate class.

public class StaticDemo {
   public static void main(String[] args)
   {
       Abc.show(); 
    }
}

class Abc
{  
    static int i = 6;
    public static void show()
    {
        System.out.println("hello");
        System.out.println(i);                          // we cant call i here if its not a static var.

    }
}

we can overload static methods.
